## [Unreleased] — JARVIS Voice & Cinematic HUD

### Added
- 🧽 **Stephen — SB Detailing CEO Telegram bot** — `server/stephen-bot.js` (zero-dependency long polling, `npm run stephen` / pm2). Answers as the CEO of SB Detailing, files `/task` and group-@mention instructions as schema-valid Mission Control tasks assigned to `agent-stephen` (self-registered on first run), reports board state via `/status` `/tasks`, and holds real conversations when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set (canned persona replies otherwise). Health verifier: `scripts/check-stephen.sh` (token → getMe → webhook conflict → process → registration → optional live send). Setup + troubleshooting: `docs/STEPHEN-BOT.md`. Live token/state files are gitignored like the rest of `.mission-control/config/`.
- 🎙️ **Two-way voice (JARVIS Voice)** — `dashboard/js/jarvis-voice.js`. Speaks via the Web Speech API (auto-selects a British English voice to match the films) and listens for spoken commands via `SpeechRecognition`. Degrades gracefully: speech output works everywhere; voice commands light up in Chrome/Edge and stay silent elsewhere.
  - Commands: status report, open chat/reports/schedules/events/GitHub, "create task …", switch theme (jarvis/matrix), mute/unmute, greeting.
  - Event announcements wired to the live WebSocket bus: new task, task DONE/BLOCKED, review submitted/approved, quota exceeded, uplink lost/restored.
- 🌀 **Cinematic HUD (JARVIS mode)** — `dashboard/js/jarvis-hud.js` + `dashboard/css/jarvis-hud.css`. Power-up boot sequence ("INITIALIZING JARVIS…"), animated arc-reactor (header logo + boot centerpiece), ambient HUD chrome (corner reticles, sweeping scan line, grid vignette), a reactive voice dock (orb + waveform + mic/mute), and live subtitles of what JARVIS says/hears.
- 🎨 **Arc-reactor blue is now the default theme** — `data-color-theme="jarvis"` with a no-flash early init. Matrix and all other themes remain selectable; JARVIS mode is toggleable (`window.toggleJarvisMode()` / the dock power button) and persisted in `localStorage`.
- ♿ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; all HUD overlays are `pointer-events:none` so they never block the UI.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-21 | OpenClaw Sessions, Cost Metrics Fix & Hardening

### Added
- 🛰️ **OpenClaw Sessions panel** — live view of active OpenClaw agent sessions (server `openclaw-sessions.js` + dashboard panel), previously shipped in code but never versioned/documented

### Fixed
- 💸 **Dashboard cost metrics were always blank** — a legacy `GET /api/costs` (ResourceManager) was registered first and shadowed the cost-tracker route the dashboard reads. The bare `GET /api/costs` now serves the cost-tracker (`{ totals: { todayCost, monthCost } }`); the filtered ResourceManager summary moved to `GET /api/costs/summary` (no functionality lost)
- 🔢 **Version drift across the repo** — `VERSION`, root + server `package.json`, dashboard badge, `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md` header, and `connect-missiondeck.sh` were all reporting different versions; everything is now aligned to `2.1.0`
- 🏷️ **Hardcoded `User-Agent: JARVIS-Mission-Control/1.4.0`** in GitHub API calls now reads the live version from `package.json`

### Security / Hardening
- 🛡️ **Request body size limit** — `express.json({ limit: '5mb' })` to prevent memory-exhaustion DoS
- 🛡️ **File download stream errors** — `GET /api/files/:path` now handles mid-transfer stream errors and cleans up on client disconnect instead of hanging the socket
- 🛡️ **RFC 5987 `Content-Disposition`** — download filenames are now URL-encoded so quotes/UTF-8 can't break out of the header
- ✅ **Task title validation** — `POST /api/tasks` rejects empty/non-string titles with `400` to prevent corrupt cards

### Removed
- 🧹 **Dead code** — deleted unused `server/file_routes_patch.js` (an orphaned, never-imported duplicate of the file routes)

---

## [2.0.8] — 2026-04-03 | Performance: Surgical Cache Updates for /api/tasks

**PR #143 — Closes #141**

### Fixed
- ⚡ **/api/tasks slow response (6781ms)** — full cache invalidation on every file write caused O(n) re-reads
- 🗄️ **Surgical O(1) cache updates** — new `updateCacheItem()` adds/updates/removes single items in-place
- 🛡️ **5-minute TTL** on all cache entries as safety net for missed fs events
- `invalidateCache()` now only fires as fallback when JSON parsing fails (partial write edge case)

---

## [2.0.4] — 2026-03-14 | Performance: Parallel File Reads + Cache

**PR #106 — Fixes #105**

### Fixed
- ⚡ **/api/tasks timeout (6500ms → <3ms)** — `readJsonDirectory()` now parallelized with `Promise.all`
- 🗄️ **In-memory directoryCache** — Map-based cache auto-invalidates via chokidar file watcher
- Response times: cold ~3ms, cached ~2ms

---

## [2.0.3] — 2026-03-04 | Smart Panels — Chat, Reports, Schedules

**PR #73 + PR #74**

### Added
- 💬 **Mission Control Chat** — slide-out panel, real-time WebSocket, agent emojis, unread badge, @mention support
- 📋 **Reports panel** — slide-out from header button, Reports/Logs/Archive tabs, fixed double `/api/` URL bug
- ⏰ **Schedules panel** — slide-out from header button, shows all 14 live OpenClaw cron jobs (fixed wrong endpoint)
- Right sidebar removed — Kanban gets full width; all panels via header buttons

### Fixed
- Smart panels not opening (mobile + desktop) — JS never added `.open` CSS class; fixed with `offsetHeight` reflow + `classList.add('open')`

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-04 | Right Panel Fixes

**PR #71**

### Fixed
- Reports "Failed to load files" — double `/api/api/` prefix bug in `api.js`
- Resources hidden from sidebar (accessible via Settings modal)
- Chat overflow off-screen resolved

---

## [2.0.1] — 2026-03-04 | Dark Mode + Getting Started Fix

**PR #70**

### Fixed
- Dashboard defaulting to white/light mode — hardcoded `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`
- "Getting Started" modal no longer blocks Kanban when server is connected

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-04 | Major UI Overhaul

**PRs #65–#69**

### Added
- **Widget Cards** (v1.16.0) — 4 large clickable stat cards: Claude Sessions, CLI Connections, GitHub Sync, Webhook Health
- **Enhanced Task Cards** (v1.17.0) — priority color bars, agent avatar circles, label badges, review indicator
- **Sidebar Groups** (v1.18.0) — TEAM / INTELLIGENCE / SYSTEM collapsible sections with localStorage persistence
- **Panel Redesign** (v1.19.0) — gradient headers, icon boxes, Orbitron titles, stat badges on all 6 panels
- **Matrix Theme Polish** (v2.0.0) — CRT scanlines, pulse-glow on agents, Matrix rain header accent, typewriter version cursor

---


## [2.0.3] — 2026-03-04 | Smart Slide-out Panels

**PR #73** — `feature/smart-panels-v2.0.3`
**PR #74** — `fix/smart-panels-open-class`

### Added
- `dashboard/js/smart-panels.js` — new module powering three on-demand panels
- **💬 Chat panel** — full-height slide-out from CHAT header button
  - Real-time via WebSocket (`message.created` events)
  - Message bubbles with per-agent emoji avatars (🔧 Tank, 🔮 Oracle, 🧠 Morpheus…)
  - Unread badge on header button when panel is closed
  - Send via `POST /api/messages`, receive via WS broadcast
- **📋 Reports & Files panel** — slide-out from REPORTS header button
  - Tabs: Reports / Logs / Archive
  - File list with ext badge, size, date, download link
  - Clean empty state
- **⏰ Schedules panel** — slide-out from SCHEDULES header button
  - Calls `/api/schedules` (was previously calling wrong endpoint `/api/queue`)
  - Shows all OpenClaw cron jobs across all agents with agent emoji, schedule type, last run
  - Filter: All / Active / Disabled
- Three header action buttons replace the removed right sidebar: CHAT · REPORTS · SCHEDULES

### Fixed
- Smart panels not opening on click (PR #74): panels use `transform: translateX(100%)` by default; `.open` CSS class slides them in — `_openPanel()` was setting `display: flex` but never adding `.open`
- `/api/schedules` now correctly returns OpenClaw cron jobs (14 real jobs); old code called `/api/queue` which only reads local queue (always empty)
- Floating chat widget replaced by slide-out (no more viewport overflow)

### Changed
- Right sidebar (`sidebar-right`) permanently hidden (`display: none !important`) — Kanban board gets full available width
- Old floating chat HTML replaced with stub divs to prevent JS errors from old references

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-04 | Right Panel Bug Fixes

**PR #70** — `fix/dark-mode-default-and-modal`
**PR #71** — `fix/right-panel-and-chat`

### Fixed
- **Dark mode not defaulting**: `initTheme()` was following `prefers-color-scheme: light` system setting; now always defaults to `'dark'` regardless of OS preference
- **Getting Started modal blocking board**: modal now only shows after 2s delay AND only when `!api.isConnected()` — server is always running so modal never fires
- **"Failed to load files" error**: `getFiles()` in `api.js` was passing `/api/files?dir=reports` to `request()` which prepends `/api`, producing URL `/api/api/files` → 404 → catch block → "Failed to load files". Fixed to `/files?dir=...`
- **Resources section removed from sidebar**: was displaying 0/0/0 with no inline actions — hidden from permanent view (Resources modal still accessible via Settings)

---
